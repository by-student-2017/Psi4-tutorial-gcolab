## Attention !!!: 
- The environment of "google colab." Will be changed immediately. Even settings that have been successfully installed in the past often do not work now.


## Note
- Reference [1] is very good. References [1,2] are written in Japanese. The following shows the results of my tests on "google colab." using reference [1,2].
